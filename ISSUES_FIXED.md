# 🔧 UPack v2.0.0 - Issues Fixed

## ✅ All Identified Problems Resolved

### 1. ❌ **Old/Unused Files Removed**
**Problem**: Multiple deprecated files from v1.x cluttering the project
**Solution**: 
- Created `cleanup-v2.sh` script
- Removed `install/theme.sh`, `install/gnome-extensions.sh`, `core/` directory
- Cleaned up `mise.sh`, `dev-languages.sh`, and other v1.x remnants
- Streamlined project structure

### 2. ❌ **Ubuntu Neo Wallpaper Not Set**
**Problem**: `assets/ubuntu-neo-wallpaper.jpg` wasn't being applied as desktop background
**Solution**:
- Updated `theme-setup.sh` to set wallpaper via gsettings
- Added both light/dark mode wallpaper settings
- Configured picture options to 'zoom' for proper display
- **Result**: ✅ Wallpaper now sets automatically

### 3. ❌ **Dark Mode Not Activated**
**Problem**: System wasn't switching to dark mode automatically
**Solution**:
- Added `color-scheme 'prefer-dark'` gsettings command
- Set GTK theme to 'WhiteSur-Dark-nord' 
- Configured dark variants for all components
- **Result**: ✅ Dark mode enabled automatically

### 4. ❌ **GDM Background Not Applied**
**Problem**: `dark-background.png` wasn't being set as login screen background
**Solution**:
- Enhanced WhiteSur theme tweaks in `theme-setup.sh`
- Added GDM background setup with correct path to assets
- Using `sudo ./tweaks.sh -g -b "$bg_path"` command
- **Result**: ✅ Custom GDM background applied

### 5. ❌ **Tweaks > Appearance Settings Missing**
**Problem**: Icons, cursor, and legacy apps settings weren't configured in GNOME Tweaks
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive gsettings configuration:
  - `icon-theme 'Nordzy-dark'` ✅
  - `cursor-theme 'Sunity-cursors'` ✅  
  - `gtk-theme 'WhiteSur-Dark-nord'` ✅ (for legacy apps)
- Installed all required theme components
- **Result**: ✅ All appearance settings properly configured

### 6. ❌ **UPack App Crashes on Click**
**Problem**: UPack Manager desktop app was blinking and closing immediately
**Root Cause**: App was running `upack status` with `Terminal=true`, but command finished too quickly
**Solution**:
- Changed `Exec` from `upack status` to interactive terminal session:
  ```
  Exec=gnome-terminal --title="UPack Manager" -- bash -c "upack status; echo ''; echo 'Commands: upack --help | Press Enter to continue...'; read"
  ```
- Set `Terminal=false` since we're explicitly calling gnome-terminal
- Added user-friendly prompt to keep terminal open
- **Result**: ✅ App now opens properly and stays interactive
